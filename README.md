# restful-expression-evaluator

The app has been hosted live [here](https://mrmallik.github.io/restful-expression-evaluator/)

# Here's what has been done-

- I am making a POST request to the API endpoint. The expression entered by the user is passed on in the Request Body.
- The API processes this request and yields a response which is then shown to the user.
- Tech stack - Fastapi (for API implementation) and JavaScript (for REST client)
- I have hosted the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Github Pages.
